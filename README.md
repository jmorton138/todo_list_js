# todo_list_js

There was a lot to learn with the project. Making use of ES6 modules took some getting used to but eventually started making it easier to clean up my code and more loosely couple my "classes". I think the biggest challenge initially was using local storage to substitute a backend. I wasn't able to reference data objects in the way I prefer.

I solved most of the problems with this project by breaking down my functions further and further, keeping the Single responsibility principle top of mind.
